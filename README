Console game "Sea battle" according to the classical rules.
 The player sets his ships:
 - one four-deck
 - two three-deck
 - three two-deck
 - four single deck
 Ships can not be bent, but you can turn them.
 The game starts automatically when the player places all ships.
 Ships are arranged by mask: <orientation> <ship size> <coordinate>
 <orientation> - 1 = vertically, 2 = horizontally
 <ship size> - 1 = one-deck, 2 = two-deck, 3 = three-deck, 4 = four-deck
 <coordinate> - coordinate of the first cell of the ship in the format <literal> <number>.

You have to write letters in Russian.
For example: 1 2 A5 = such a command will vertically put a two-deck ship at points A5 and A6
2 4 Б6 = such a command will put horizontally a four-deck ship at points Б6 В6 Г6 and Д6

After the arrangement of the ships, firing begins directly. For shooting, you need to enter the cell coordinate of the computer field in the format <letter> <digit>.
For example: A1, к10, б3, etc.
